A sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage

"Hey! Listen! It's time to wake up and begin your quest!" That's what the shiny flying thing told me before leaving without any other explanation... So I took my sword and my shield and started to explore the world to find what was going on.

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I'm finally done with this mod :D I can't remember the longest time I spent on a mod already, but this one took me a long time for sure X) Good thing that I didn't try to add this in the MMORPGoat mod as I was planning to do or it would not be out yet... Anyway I really wanted to make this mod as good as possible so I took the time needed for that :p
There was a few challenges for me to solve in this mod: First, making a usable sword and shield. Making them actually collide with people and objects and only when I wanted to (no collision when they are on your back) was not as easy as it seems. Anyway after finding the correct functions I got it working and that was really enjoyable to play with ^^
As you probably noticed, I literally copied the attacks of Link in the classic Zelda games, and I tried to make my version as close as possible to the original ;) That's why I also added a master sword upgrade system (the Hero Sword) with a pedestal randomly placed in the world. For more fun I added a "repulsion" effect on this pedestal, so that only goats who deserve it can get the Hero Sword! Understand: only goats using the mutator can actually take the sword.
Then I started to work on the most fun part of this mod: the laser swords :D Still trying to mimic the original Zelda mechanisms, I made the Hero Sword "shoot" laser copies of itself. I had some trouble to make those swords actually fly properly and in the right direction, but after messing enough with their physics properties I eventually got a satisfying result.
And finally, since the last game update I knew that the cel shading effect (or Borderlands effect, or whatever) should now be working so I really wanted to include it in this mod (as some Zelda games also use this kind of graphisms). The first thing I saw when I tried it was a big blue and white default texture in fullscreen XD Which means the visual effect was not correctly configured to work in this game... Anyway I wanted it really hard so I started messing with the post process effect itself in the editor until I found a way to make it correctly visible ^^ After that I spend a lot of time tweaking the parameters of the effect to get something good looking: at the beginning almost all the screen was black in the foreground because there as way too much lines drawn everywhere >_< In the end, the solution came from SKaa3w (a big thanks to him!) who posted a customized version of this visual effect on [url=https://forums.epicgames.com/threads/988232-UDK-x-UT3-Sobel-Edge-Detection-Post-Process-Effect-VFIX-(-Download-)]the unreal forums[/url]. That version was almost rendering perfectly on Goat Simulator, I only modified it a bit to adjust the size of the black lines and have a really good looking result ^^
